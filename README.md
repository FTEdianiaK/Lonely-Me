### About

**Made in one (1) day for the 1-BIT JAM, the topic was "Light & Dark"**

*(in this case interpreted as "Hope & Despair")*

Embark on a journey across the (side) planet of Myesic and listen to the tale of the lonely Me, who hopes to one day meet their future bestie from Zemye. Help Me construct a device called Playta, that will hopefully be able to reach Zemye. Just steer clear of the sinister looking DPU.
